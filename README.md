# study_helper

This is a *yet-to-be-named* project created by [UpWiSE](https://upwisesc.org/)

Most folks know how to use ChatGPT or other generative AI tools to gather information, but not necessarily to their best ability.

We'd like to build a useful AI tool to help people who want to study something, but are overwhelmed with the sheer number of resources there are to learn the concepts. We'll start with useful software engineering skills so this will be immediately useful to our community, but the concept can apply to anything you desire.

The ultimate goal is to alleviate "analysis paralysis" and let the tool design a curriculum for you.

Given the time the user has to study (5 min to 2 hours), the tools they have available (smartphone, tablet, laptop, pen and paper, books, etc), the environment you are in (home, airplane, coffee shop, etc), and other specific preferences, the app will return a study guide in a friendly and exportable format and include options for audio, video, text based, and interactive learning.

More to come on the use cases for this tool!

This project is part of 🎃#Hacktoberfest2024, supported by UpWiSE.  All are welcome to work on issues and join in!

### How to Help This Project
1. Before beginning any work, please review the Issues for this repository to see what work is available.  The following filter shows which issues do not have an Assignee, and can be assigned: [Unassigned Issue Filter for the Study Helper](https://github.com/UpstateWomenInSoftwareEngineering/study_helper/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+no%3Aassignee)
2. When you find an issue you'd like to take on, leave a comment to request that you be assigned to the issue.
3. Once a project admin assigns the issue to you, you can begin the issue work! ✨
4. Clone the repository locally, then create a Branch to begin working on the issue.
5. Begin working on the branch in your local space. When the work is complete, Commit your changes to the branch. Then, create a Pull request to submit your changes.
6. In the Pull request, be sure to include a clear description with what your changes includes and a statement with “Closes #” referencing the issue that should close related to the pull request.
7. An UpWiSE team member will review your Pull Request.
    - If the request is good without changes, it will be Approved.
    - If changes are needed, will we write to you with a comment about what to change.
8. Hacktoberfest Details: After the PR is approved, the reviewer will add the "hacktoberfest-accepted" label.  Then, the Hacktoberfest project itself will need time to account for the activity.  When it does, you will be able to see the accepted PR in your Hacktoberfest.com account.
    - Additional details about Hacktoberfest 2024 are in [our UpWiSE Notion space here](https://pinnate-goldenrod-da6.notion.site/Hacktoberfest-2024-1180faf7365880f78958dee6b52c7937?pvs=4).

### Technical Stack

### Initial Setup Instructions
*TBD, awaiting initial project check-in*

### Setup your .env file
In order to access your OpenAI API Key it is necessary to create a .env file. 

1. If you don't already have an OpenAI API Key, sign up for an account on [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/signup/), then head on over to the [API Keys section](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys), create a new secret key, and copy it.
2. In your terminal, run ``touch .env`` or, if you're using VSCode (for example), simply create a ``.env`` file in the project root directory. 
3. Open the ``.env`` file and add your key to it:     
  
  

```bash  
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-secret-key
```

4. Save your ``.env`` file. 
  
  
    

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT:**
> Make sure to add your ``.env`` file to your ``.gitignore`` ! Sharing your personal API keys is a security risk.
