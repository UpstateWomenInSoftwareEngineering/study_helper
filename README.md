# study_helper

This is a *yet-to-be-named* project created by [UpWiSE](https://upwisesc.org/)

Most folks know how to use ChatGPT or other generative AI tools to gather information, but not necessarily to their best ability.

We'd like to build a useful AI tool to help people who want to study something, but are overwhelmed with the sheer number of resources there are to learn the concepts. We'll start with useful software engineering skills so this will be immediately useful to our community, but the concept can apply to anything you desire.

The ultimate goal is to alleviate "analysis paralysis" and let the tool design a curriculum for you.

Given the time the user has to study (5 min to 2 hours), the tools they have available (smartphone, tablet, laptop, pen and paper, books, etc), the environment you are in (home, airplane, coffee shop, etc), and other specific preferences, the app will return a study guide in a friendly and exportable format and include options for audio, video, text based, and interactive learning.

More to come on the use cases for this tool!

This project is part of 🎃#Hacktoberfest2024, supported by UpWiSE.  All are welcome to work on issues and join in!

The following filter shows which issues do not have an Assignee, and can be assigned: [Unassigned Issue Filter for the Study Helper](https://github.com/UpstateWomenInSoftwareEngineering/study_helper/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+no%3Aassignee)
2. When you find an issue you'd like to take on, leave a comment to request that you be assigned to the issue.
3. Once a project admin assigns the issue to you, you can begin the issue work! ✨
4. Clone the repository locally, then create a Branch to begin working on the issue.
5. Begin working on the branch in your local space. When the work is complete, Commit your changes to the branch. Then, create a Pull request to submit your changes.
6. In the Pull request, be sure to include a clear description with what your changes includes and a statement with “Closes #” referencing the issue that should close related to the pull request.
7. An UpWiSE team member will review your Pull Request.
    - If the request is good without changes, it will be Approved.
    - If changes are needed, will we write to you with a comment about what to change.
8. Hacktoberfest Details: After the PR is approved, the reviewer will add the "hacktoberfest-accepted" label.  Then, the Hacktoberfest project itself will need time to account for the activity.  When it does, you will be able to see the accepted PR in your Hacktoberfest.com account.
